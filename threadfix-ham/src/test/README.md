These tests require a specific set of sample projects and requires some configuration.

The base path for the test projects folder, which you must create and populate yourself, must be provided as a parameter when running tests - `-DPROJECTS_ROOT=<root_folder_path>`. `<root_folder_path>` should be an absolute path ending in `/`. Any folder separators should use `/`.

The following named projects and their download locations are listed below.
